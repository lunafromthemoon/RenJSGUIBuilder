What's this?

These files are a build from the RenJS GUIBuilder tool. With this structure you're one step away to start your game. Your very own GUI and all its assets, along with the boot.js file are ready to be used into a game. 

What's missing?

If execute this game as you would do with the Quickstart, you'll see your GUI in action, but the story itself has nothing to show. You can now start adding your story assets in the assets directory, setting them up in the Setup.yaml file, and writing the story script in the Story.yaml. Don't forget also to check the configuration properties in Config.yaml and change it as your story needs.
