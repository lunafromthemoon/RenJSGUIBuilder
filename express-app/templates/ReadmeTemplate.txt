What's this?

These files are a build from the RenJS GUIBuilder tool. With this structure you're one step away to start your game. Your very own GUI and all its assets, along with the boot.js file are ready to be used into a game. 

What's missing?

If you try to execute this build like you would the Quickstart it will not work at all, since it's missing the RenJS V2 library. You can download the latest version of RenJS V2 in www.renjs.fr.

Once you have the library, add it under the RenJS directory, next to the boot.js file. If you try to execute it now, it will show your new GUI in action, but without any story assets.

You can now start adding your story assets in the assets directory, setting the up in the Setup.yaml file, and writing the story script in the Story.yaml. Don't forget also to check the configuration properties in Config.yaml and change it as your story needs.
